# Machine Learning Project: Twitter Sentiment Analysis

> Performed data analysis and cleaning on the Sentiment140 dataset. Proceeded to then train a bunch of different supervised machine-learning models on the cleaned dataset. 

## Description

One Python script is for cleaning and processing the data as well as displaying the data in simpler ways that make data analysis easier; The other is for running multiple machine learning models on the TFIDF and CountVectorizor data such as Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Perceptrons, multilayer perceptron classifier, XGBClassifier, XGBRFClassifier, RandomForests, Decision Trees, Bernoulli and Multinomial Naive Bayes, LinearSVC, and KNN. Most of these are from the ScikitLearn Library but a couple are from the TensorFlow and XGBoost libraries.

## Features

- Simple code for processing the text using TDIDF and CountVectorizor.
- Has multiple graph types for pre and post-cleaning data analysis.
- An extra non-text feature was added to the processed dataset.
- Code for running multiple supervised machine learning models.

## Getting Started

- You can inspect the jupyter notebooks for the code.
